            <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
            <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in
                Manhattan, New York to Howard Stark, a famous genius inventor and businessman, and Maria Stark, a
                socialite and philanthropist.
                Growing up under the eye of family butler Edwin Jarvis, his life was characterized by a cold and
                affectionless relationship with his father. Seeing
                that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own
                role in the creation of Captain America. This instead embittered Stark, who felt
                that his father was taking more pride in his creations than in his family. A brilliant and unique child
                prodigy, Stark attended MIT for two years starting at age 14, and graduated summa cum laude at 17.[5]


                On December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the Bahamas, but planned to stop at
                the Pentagon to deliver Super Soldier Serum Howard had redeveloped. Instead, both are killed in a car
                accident—later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the Winter Soldier, who was
                mind-controlled by Hydra to steal the serum.[a] As a result, Stark inherited his father's company,
                becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and
                inventor, and lived a playboy lifestyle. At a New Year's Eve party for the new millennium, he attended a
                conference in Bern where he met scientists Maya Hansen, inventor of the Extremis experimental
                regenerative treatment, and Aldrich Killian, rejecting an offer to work
                for Killian's Advanced Idea Mechanics.[b]</p>

            <h2>IRON MAN</h2>
            <img src="ironman.jpg" id="photo2" height="200px">
            <p>In 2010, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel
                James Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is
                ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow
                captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from
                reaching his heart and killing him.

                Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power
                Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen
                sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of
                the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing
                in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer
                manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his
                improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor.

                Stark learns that Obadiah Stane has been engaged in arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is
                staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan
                and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest,
                revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor
                to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being
                "Iron Man."</p>
